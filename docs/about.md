# Möbius Aromaticity

**Möbius aromaticity** is a special type of aromaticity where a compound does not follow huckle's rule because it develops a **twist**, like a Möbius strip. But still remains aromatic. More details will be explained in this section.

## What is Möbius Aromaticity?

Möbius aromatic compounds: 

 1) Are **cyclic** and **conjugated** 

 2) They obtain a 180 degree twist once before connecting like a Möbius strip.  

 3) Still have a continuous overlap of p orbital.  

 4) Follow a different electron rule than standard aromatic compounds.

## Hückel vs Möbius aromaticity

| property              | Hückel Aromaticity          | Möbius Aromaticity        |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Planarity            | Must be planar              | Must be twisted            |
| π-electron rule      | 4n + 2 π electrons          | 4n π electrons             |
| Stability            | Highly stable               | Stable under certain conditions |
| Example compound     | Benzene                     | Möbius annulene (theoretical)   |
