# Introduction to aromaticity 

**Aromaticity** is a concept in organic chemistry that explains the stability of many compounds and why they don't often involve themselves in reactions.

## Rules for aromaticity

For a molecule to be **aromatic**, it must be:

1. **Cyclic** – The molecule must form a ring.
2. **Planar** – The ring must be flat.
3. **Conjugated** – Every atom in the ring must have a p-orbital.
4. **(4n + 2) π electrons** – The ring must have 2, 6, 10, ...., pi electrons.

This last rule is known as **Hückel’s Rule**, where `n` is any non negative integer.

## Examples of Aromatic Compounds

| Molecule      | π Electrons | Aromatic? |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Benzene       | 6           |  Yes     | 
| Pyrrole       | 6           |  Yes     | 
| Furan         | 6           |  Yes     | 
| Cyclobutadiene| 4           |  No      | 
| Cyclooctatetraene| 8        |  No      |

## Some exceptions: Antiaromatic vs Non-Aromatic

- **Antiaromatic**: compounds which follow all aromaticity rules but instead of (4n + 2) π, they have **4n π electrons** 
- **Non-aromatic**: does not follow more than one criteria.
